      <p> Robert John Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965, in Manhattan, New York City, the younger of two children. His father, Robert Downey Sr., was a filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann (n√©e Ford), was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.'s films. Downey's father was one-half Lithuanian Jewish, one-quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one-quarter Irish, while Downey's mother had Scottish, German, and Swiss ancestry. During his childhood, Downey had minor roles in his father's films. 
Downey's parents divorced in 1977, when he was twelve. He went and lived with his mother in a fifth-floor apartment in New York, as she "needed" him after the divorce, while his sister went to live with their father in California. After a few years, Downey went to live with his father and began attending Santa Monica High School, but dropped out in 1982. At the age of 17, he moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time. Downey worked a number of different jobs to support himself while going to auditions, including clearing tables at Central Falls restaurant, working in a shoe store, and performing as "living art" at the nightclub Area. Meanwhile, Downey got a few parts in local theater and off-Broadway productions.
<br>
Unfortunately, Downey's Hollywood path set him towards multiple altercations with narcotics and frequent fights with fellow stars.
However, in recent times, Downey has made an illustrious comeback career into the modern movie going sphere and secured a legacy that is unrivaled.
